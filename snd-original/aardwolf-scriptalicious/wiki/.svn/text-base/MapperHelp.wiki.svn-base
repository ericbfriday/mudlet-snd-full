#Help on getting the most out of Fiendish's mapper plugin

= Disclaimer! =

Hi, I didn't write it, but I use it and leverage it in my plugin.  *Fiendish's mapper plugin*. To use my triple pack you're going to want to know these fundamentals first!

= Creating CExits (aka Custom Exits) =
== To open a door ==
{{{
   mapper cexit open n;;n
}}}
This will *teach* to mapper to open a door and walk through it.

=== Detailed Steps ===
  * find a closed door north 
  * type *mapper cexit open n;;n* (note the 2 ;'s)
  * wait 2 seconds, you will see a blue mapping confirm message.. 

=== To Test ===
  * go south back to the first room 
  * close the door north 
  * on the clickable map.. click on the room north of you 
  * you will see the mapper open the door and walk you through it

== To get into tricky/annoying areas ==
Some areas require CExits to get into them.. and excellent example is "First Ascent".  To see First Acent's speedwalk with cexit type *speedwalk first*
{{{
Area Name                       Speedwalk 
The First Ascent                run 19s4w;climb the chain
}}}

Type *speedwalk* for a full list of areas with cexits.

=== Detailed Steps ===
  * Go to the Aylor room `GreyAsh Alley to Silvermist Road` (from Recall type *run 19s4w*)
  * type *exits*  to see the command for the custom exit (in this case it's *climb the chain*)
  * type *mapper cexit climb the chain*
  * wait 2 seconds for mapper to confirm the room

=== To test ===
  * recall
  * type *xrt first*

= To Add a Portal to your Mapper = 
  * Have an alias that gets the portal out of your bag, holds it, enters it, puts the portal back in your bag, and re-holds whatever you were holding. (_ in this example we will use one called "portal_losttime"_)
  * Invoke that alias and stand in the room where the portal takes you
  * Note the *listed* level of the portal (do not take tier into account)
  * Type *mapper portal portal_losttime* (for example), when prompted, type in the portal level
  * Done!  Now Mapper will take your portals and level into consideration when calculating the fastest path!

== Making a basic portal alias ==

*You will NEED to change "bag", "hold/dual" and "myOldItem" for this to work!*

{{{
<aliases>
  <alias
   match="port *"
   enabled="y"
   expand_variables="y"
   ignore_case="y"
   sequence="100"
  >
  <send>get '%1' bag
hold '%1'
enter
hold/dual myOldItem
put '%1' bag</send>
  </alias>
</aliases>
}}}

=== Usage ===
The following would work for mapping an envelope of xyl portal
  1) go to the portal destination
  2) type
{{{
mapper portal port envelope
}}}
